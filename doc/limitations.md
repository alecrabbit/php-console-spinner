### Limitations

In zero dependencies "mode", the library has the following limitations:
- ❗ **Only synchronous mode is available.**
- Terminal color support can not be detected thus it is set to 256 colors by default. Can be overridden manually.
- Terminal width can not be detected thus it is set to 100 by default. Can be overridden manually.
- Frame width can not be determined thus it is user responsibility to set it properly.
- Signal handling is not supported.

### How to overcome limitations?

- For asynchronous mode install one of supported event loop libraries.
- For extended terminal support install [terminal library]()
- For frame width auto-detection install `alecrabbit/php-wcwidth` [🔗](https://github.com/alecrabbit/php-wcwidth)
- Install `ext-pcntl` extension for signal handling feature.

### Windows support
- To run spinner spiced applications on Windows you should have some *nix-like terminal emulator installed.
  - VT100 terminal, e.g. [minTTY](https://github.com/mintty/mintty).
